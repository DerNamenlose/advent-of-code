# Advent of Code collection

This is my private collection of solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) each year (well, as long, as I can be bothered to follow along).

Solutions might be in different programming languages, might be more or less efficient/ridiculous and are generally unsupported by me once I've finished the task
for the day. What I'm saying is: basically this is a dump for my personal solutions and not a teaching instrument. Take from it what you will. Refrain from laughing 
too loud in case they are ridiculous.
